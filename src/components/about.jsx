                Once you’re set up, simply press the GoToBed button as a personal commitment to put your phone down and prepare for restful sleep. The app then tracks your sleep journey and lets you reflect with a journaling feature—where you can plan your dreams or capture sleepy thoughts to revisit later.

                Please note: DreamWeaver is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice. For issues like snoring, sleep apnea, or chronic insomnia, it’s best to consult a healthcare professional or undergo a sleep study. However, by writing down your sleep experiences and taking mindful steps toward improvement, DreamWeaver can help reduce stress and support better rest.
